# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence is the ability of a machine to imitate the cognitive abilities and problem-solving capabilities of human intelligence.

## Human Intelligence
Humans can:
- Learn new skills through observation
- Think abstractly and reason logically
- Communicate using language and non-verbal cues (e.g., facial expressions)
- Handle complex situations in real time
- Plan short-term and long-term actions
- Create art, images, music, and inventions

If we replicate these capabilities in machines, it leads to **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** — machines that mimic human abilities and perform complex tasks without human intervention.

When AI is applied to solve **specific, narrow objectives**, it is called **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** (also referred to as Narrow AI).

## Why Do We Need AI?
- Huge amounts of data that humans cannot efficiently observe or process
- Automation and decision-making (reducing human effort)
  - Example: Product recommendations
- Creative support

# Language AI

## Text-Related Tasks
- Detect language
- Extract entities from text
- Extract key phrases
- Understand sentiment
- Classify text based on content
- Translate text

## Generative AI (Language)
- Create stories and poems
- Summarize text
- Answer questions

## Language AI Models
Language AI models are designed to understand, process, and generate natural language.  
They rely on large amounts of text data and perform **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks.

### Common Models
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**  
  Process data sequentially and store information in hidden states.

- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**  
  Improved RNNs that retain context using gating mechanisms.

- **Transformers**  
  Process data in parallel using self-attention to understand context better.

# AI vs ML vs DL

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  
  Machines that imitate human intelligence.

- **Machine Learning (ML)**  
  Algorithms learn from past data to predict outcomes or identify patterns.

- **Deep Learning (DL)**  
  Uses neural networks to learn from complex data and generate new data.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled data
- Learns patterns to predict outcomes

### Unsupervised Learning
- Uses unlabeled data
- Extracts hidden patterns and clusters

### Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through trial and error
- Uses rewards and feedback from the environment

## Training a Model to Predict Outcomes
- A model is trained using data samples
- The algorithm incrementally updates model parameters
- Once trained, the model predicts outcomes on new data
