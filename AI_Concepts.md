# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## What is Artificial Intelligence?
**Artificial Intelligence** is the ability of a machine to imitate the cognitive abilities and problem-solving capabilities of human intelligence.

## Human Intelligence
Humans are capable of:
- Learning new skills through observation
- Thinking abstractly and reasoning
- Communicating using language and non-verbal cues (e.g., facial expressions)
- Handling complex situations in real time
- Planning short-term and long-term actions
- Creating art, images, music, and inventions

If we can replicate any of these capabilities in machines, it is referred to as **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**, where machines mimic human abilities to perform complex tasks without human intervention.

When AGI is applied to solve a **specific, narrow objective**, it is called **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

## Why Do We Need AI?
- Large amounts of data that humans are incapable of observing and processing efficiently
- Automation and decision-making (reducing human effort)
  - Example: recommending products to users
- Creative support

## Language Domain (Text-Related Tasks)
- Detect language
- Extract entities from text
- Extract key phrases
- Understand sentiment of text
- Classify text based on content
- Translate text

### Generative AI (Language)
- Create stories and poems
- Summarize text
- Answer questions

## Language AI Models
Language AI models are designed to understand, process, and generate natural language.  
They rely on large amounts of text data to perform **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

### Common Models
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**  
  Process data sequentially and store information in hidden states.

- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**  
  Processes data sequentially and retains context better using gates.

- **Transformers**  
  Process data in parallel and use self-attention to better understand context.

## Vision AI Models
Vision AI models are designed to process and understand visual information from images and videos (pixels).

### Common Models
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  
  Detect patterns in images and learn hierarchical visual features.

- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**  
  Processes images and detects objects within a single pass.

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**  
  Generate realistic-looking images.

## Other AI Tasks
- Detect anomalies in time-series data
- Fraud detection
- Product recommendation using similar user data (e-commerce)
- Forecasting future events using past data  
  - Examples: weather forecasting, stock price prediction

# AI vs ML vs DL

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Machines imitate human intelligence.

## Machine Learning (ML)
Algorithms learn from past data to:
- Predict outcomes on new data
- Identify trends from historical data

## Deep Learning (DL)
Algorithms learn from complex data using neural networks to:
- Predict outcomes
- Generate new data

---

## Machine Learning Types

### Supervised Learning
- Extracts rules from labeled data

### Unsupervised Learning
- Extracts patterns and trends from unlabeled data

### Reinforcement Learning
- Solves tasks by trial and error
- Learns from environment feedback and rewards

---

## Training a Model to Predict Outcomes
- A model is trained to perform a specific task
- The algorithm incrementally updates the model using data samples
- Once trained, the model can predict outcomes on new data

### Training Flow
- Input Data → Model → Prediction
